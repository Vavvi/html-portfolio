<h1>My Favourite Movies Of All Time</h1>
<h2>Top 3 Rankings</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Shutter Island</h3>
<p>Personally, I think shutter island is one of Leonardo DiCaprios best films.
    His performance is unmatched by any other, and the twist ending has stayed with me 
    ever since I watched it.</p>
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>The first studio ghibli movie I ever watched, and I fell in love with it as a child.
    The soundtrack and animation style is breathtaking, and really feels magical.</p>
<h3>Coraline</h3>
<p>Coraline is one of the reasons I fell in love with stop motion movies. The creepy
    atmosphere created is seriously unmatched by anthing else.</p>
